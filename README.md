Description
Purpose of Website
My website is an informational tool that helps users learn about 1 must-visit work of Architecture (in my view) in each state within the United States. 

Information conveyed in website
The website conveys 2 types of information. First, it conveys the density of architectural works across the US, by state. Second, for each state, it spotlights one work of architecture that is a must-visit, and presents information about the work itself - like when it was built, who the architect is, why it was built, and what purpose it serves today.

How It’s Interesting and Engaging
What makes it engaging is the way the information is presented - in the form of an interactive map. Clicking on a state will trigger an animation that reveals the work of Architecture.
What makes it interesting, in my view, is that the project reflects my dual interest in HCI and Architecture and my passion for travel outside of academics. The website conveys my personal experiences/interests since the works of Architecture I plan to showcase include some that I have visited and loved and others that I hope to visit someday.

Target Audience
The target audience for this tool is anyone interested in Architecture and travel. Users can read about these works of Architecture for fun or even get ideas for their next trip. 


Using the Website
Hover over map
Click state to reveal architectural work
Exit modal


External Libraries 
Tool: Bootstrap
Why I Chose to Use It: I chose to use it because I wanted to implement what was demonstrated in class on my own for both responsive design and using Bootstrap’s components.
How I Used It: I used it in my html code to make my website responsive and to create the modals for the architecture spotlights.
What it Adds to my Website: Bootstrap adds responsiveness and interactivity to my website.


Iteration from HW7
I had to scope down my project from HW7. Not every state on the map is clickable. 


Major Challenges
Making the interactive map was by far my biggest challenge. Learning how to access the different elements of an SVG and be able to manipulate them using CSS in the cleanest way possible took a while a lot of trial and error and debugging.
