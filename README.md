**Description**\
Purpose of Website\
My website is an informational tool that helps users learn about 1 must-visit work of Architecture (in my view) in each state within the United States. 

Information conveyed in website\
The website conveys 2 types of information. First, it conveys the density of architectural works across the US, by state. Second, for each state, it spotlights one work of architecture that is a must-visit, and presents information about the work itself - like when it was built, who the architect is, why it was built, and what purpose it serves today.

How Itâ€™s Interesting and Engaging\
What makes it engaging is the way the information is presented - in the form of an interactive map. Clicking on a state will trigger an animation that reveals the work of Architecture.\
What makes it interesting, in my view, is that the project reflects my dual interest in HCI and Architecture and my passion for travel outside of academics. The website conveys my personal experiences/interests since the works of Architecture I plan to showcase include some that I have visited and loved and others that I hope to visit someday.

Target Audience\
The target audience for this tool is anyone interested in Architecture and travel. Users can read about these works of Architecture for fun or even get ideas for their next trip.


**Using the Website**
1. Hover over map to highlight states
2. Click on state of choice to reveal architectural work
3. Close modal (hit 'x') to go back to the map

**External Libraries**\
*Tool*: Bootstrap

*Why I Chose to Use I*t: I chose to use it because I wanted to experiment with a library I had never used before and implement somee things we learned in lab. I found Bootstrap to be a promising option for my main purpose - making a modal window.

*How I Used It*: I used it to create a modal for spotlighting a work of architecture.

*What it Adds to my Website*: It adds interactivity to my website.

**Iteration from HW7**\
I had to scope down my project from HW7. Not every state on the map is clickable. I also had to modify the spotlight modals, specifically the carousels to show just 1 image at a time and remove the thumbails of other images.
Animation was added on hovering and clicking the modal.

**Major Challenges**\
Making the interactive map was by far my biggest challenge. Learning how to access the different elements of an SVG and be able to manipulate them using CSS took me a while - especially because it was not taught in class - and a lot of trial and error/debugging.
